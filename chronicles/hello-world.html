<p>The aim of this chronicle is to record the history of this site. How long will this post be? I do not know yet. Time will tell.</p>

<p>How to create a personal website or blog? Going to <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> and create an account would be the first answer. It may be the most straight forward way to do it, but not the best approach for a personal website in my opinion. I find lots of problems with this method. The biggest one: you must take your credit card out if you do not want some random advertising pop-up to appear on your beautiful, new, personal place on the internet. Furthermore, the infrastructure is overkill to only display some text.</p>
<p>I want something easy to read without advertisement and crap for you and easy to implement for me.</p>
<p>I could have written the entire website in raw HTML. The problem is that HTML is not the prettiest language to look at and I do not want to see tags everywhere in my text when I write a post. I choose to write the posts in markdown and convert them with <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>. For the style of the website, because I am lazy and do not want to think about it, I took the CSS from <a href="https://chriswere.neocities.org/">Chris Were’s website</a> (by the way, he makes some good Linux content). To make the text readable, I followed some <a href="http://webtypography.net/">typography advise</a> that I found thanks to <a href="https://www.sylvaindurand.org/">Sylvain Durand’s journal</a>.</p>
<p>Using a static site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> was also a possibility, but I find more interesting to do all the process by myself.</p>
<p>At the end, I obtained a simple static website with HTML and CSS files only. It is small, crazy fast to load, and without all the useless trackers trying to learn about you that most websites love to use.</p>
<p>From now on, I will post the content that I want to share. Without specific aims.</p>
